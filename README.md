### 1. [Release notes template for a system that uses a multi-service architecture](https://github.com/VikramJohn/my-portfolio/tree/main/docs-release-notes)

This template builds release notes pages using Hugo with the Docsy theme implemented as a submodule. You can tag release notes by two categories---component and service---and filter displayed release notes by these tags. 

My target while creating the template was the [Kubernetes release notes page](https://relnotes.k8s.io/), which sadly seems to be broken now. 

### 2. Install a specific version of postgres on an Ubuntu system
