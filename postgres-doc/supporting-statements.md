# Installing PostgreSQL 15.3 on Ubuntu from Archived Sources

## Context
Standard Ubuntu repositories and PostgreSQL's APT repository don't 
maintain old patch versions (15.3 specifically). This guide walks 
through installing PostgreSQL 15.3 from source tarballs when specific 
version pinning is required.

**When to use this guide:** When your application requires a specific 
PostgreSQL version for compatibility or testing purposes.

**Prerequisites:**
- Ubuntu 20.04 or 22.04
- Sudo access
- Basic command line familiarity

## Installation Steps

### 1. Locate and Download the Correct Tarball
[Your steps here - this shows research skills]

### 2. Prepare the Build Environment
[Dependencies, build tools - shows systems knowledge]

### 3. Create PostgreSQL System User
[User creation, security considerations]

### 4. Extract and Build PostgreSQL
[Compilation steps, configuration flags]

### 5. Configure PostgreSQL
[Data directory, config files, permissions]

### 6. Initialize and Start the Database
[Initialization commands, service setup]

### 7. Verify Installation
[Connection testing, version checking]

## Troubleshooting

WRITING SAMPLE #1: Ubuntu Systems Administration
"Installing PostgreSQL 15.3 on Ubuntu from Archived Sources"

Context: Professional work task requiring installation of specific 
database versions not available through standard package managers.

What this demonstrates:
- Ubuntu command-line proficiency and systems administration
- User and permission management
- Problem-solving when standard documentation doesn't apply
- Writing for technical audiences (developers/DBAs)
- Structured as Diátaxis "how-to guide" - task-oriented documentation
  solving a specific real-world problem

Note: Originally written as internal documentation [X years ago]. 
Reformatted for this portfolio using Diátaxis principles and 
expanded with additional context.

## In Your Application Cover Letter

"In my previous role, I documented complex Ubuntu systems administration
tasks, including version-specific PostgreSQL and MySQL installations
requiring manual compilation from source tarballs, user management,
and troubleshooting. This work required deep understanding of Linux
package management, file permissions, and database configuration -
directly applicable to documenting Canonical's infrastructure products."
