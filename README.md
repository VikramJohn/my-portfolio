### 1. [Release notes template for a system that uses a multi-service architecture](https://github.com/VikramJohn/my-portfolio/blob/main/multiservice-rn-template)

If you ship a processing system that includes multiple services that your clients subscribe to selectively, each release note pertains to one or more services. This template allows you to tag release notes by two categories---component and service---and filter displayed release notes by these tags.

The template is built using Hugo with Docsy as a submodule.
